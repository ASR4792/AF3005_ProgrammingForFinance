# Smart Financial Management System - SecureBank

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of the **Smart Financial Management System** for SecureBank. The system is designed to automate various financial operations using Python, with interactive elements powered by `ipywidgets`. The project is divided into five key modules, each focusing on a different aspect of financial management.


## Implementation Details
1. **Loan Eligibility Checker:** Checks employment, income, and credit score to determine loan approval and interest rates.
2. **Investment Risk Assessment:** Classifies portfolio risk as High, Medium, or Low based on stock returns.
3. **Loan Repayment Tracker:** Tracks loan balance with fixed monthly payments.
4. **Stock Price Monitoring and Trading Strategy:** Monitors stock prices and triggers a sale at a target price.
5. **Currency Exchange Rate Tracker:** Tracks daily exchange rate changes until a target is reached.

## How to Run
- Open the notebook in Jupyter.
- Ensure `ipywidgets` is installed (`pip install ipywidgets`).
- Run each cell sequentially for interactive functionality.
